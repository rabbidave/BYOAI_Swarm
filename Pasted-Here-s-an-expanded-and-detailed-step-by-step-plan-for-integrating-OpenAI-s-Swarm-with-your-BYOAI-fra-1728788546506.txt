Here’s an expanded and detailed step-by-step plan for integrating OpenAI’s Swarm with your BYOAI framework while validating changes through unit testing:

---

### **Objective:**
Modify the BYOAI framework to integrate OpenAI’s Swarm framework and adopt context-driven terminology. Validate changes through unit testing and conduct system-wide integration tests to ensure successful implementation.

### **Step-by-Step Execution Plan:**

---

### **Step 1: Clone the BYOAI Repository**

#### **Task:**
Clone the BYOAI framework to your local environment and install dependencies.

#### **Commands:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rabbidave/byoai.git
cd byoai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Unit Test:**
Verify that the repository has been successfully cloned and all dependencies (Flask, requests, pyyaml) have been installed.

#### **Expected Output:**
All dependencies should be successfully installed without errors, confirmed by running:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

---

### **Step 2: Rename Environment Variables**

#### **Task:**
Rename existing environment variables in `byoai-script.py` to adopt context-driven terminology (e.g., `WORKFLOW_DIR` to `CONTEXT_WORKFLOW_DIR`, `AGENT_API_PORT` to `CONTEXT_AGENT_PORT`, etc.).

#### **Command (find-and-replace):**
```bash
sed -i 's/WORKFLOW_DIR/CONTEXT_WORKFLOW_DIR/g' byoai-script.py
sed -i 's/AGENT_API_PORT/CONTEXT_AGENT_PORT/g' byoai-script.py
```

#### **Unit Test:**
Create a simple test script to verify that the renamed variables work properly by executing `byoai-script.py` and confirming that the modified variables are operational.

```python
import os

def test_environment_variables():
    assert os.getenv("CONTEXT_WORKFLOW_DIR") is not None, "CONTEXT_WORKFLOW_DIR is not set"
    assert os.getenv("CONTEXT_AGENT_PORT") is not None, "CONTEXT_AGENT_PORT is not set"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_environment_variables()
```

#### **Expected Output:**
The environment variables should be correctly renamed, with no old variables left in the code. Running `byoai-script.py` should work without errors.

---

### **Step 3: Update Docker and Kubernetes Configurations**

#### **Task:**
Modify `docker-compose.yml` and Kubernetes configuration files to reflect the new context-driven environment variables.

#### **Commands (example for Docker):**
Update `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  byoai-agent:
    environment:
      - CONTEXT_WORKFLOW_DIR=/app/workflows
      - CONTEXT_AGENT_PORT=5000
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

#### **Unit Test:**
Deploy agents using Docker or Kubernetes, then validate that the containers are using the renamed variables.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Check the environment variables inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it byoai-agent printenv | grep CONTEXT
```

#### **Expected Output:**
Agents should successfully use the new context variables and register appropriately.

---

### **Step 4: Integrate with Swarm’s Decentralized Agents**

#### **Task:**
Adjust agent behavior to dynamically pull tasks from a shared context repository using Swarm’s decentralized approach.

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. Modify the `byoai-agent.py` to retrieve tasks from a shared context repository (such as a Swarm context server).
2. Integrate Swarm’s task-pulling behavior into the BYOAI agents, ensuring they can discover tasks and workflows in a decentralized manner.

```python
# Pseudo-code for integrating with Swarm's decentralized task pulling
import swarm

def pull_tasks_from_swarm():
    context_repo = swarm.ContextRepository()
    tasks = context_repo.get_tasks()
    return tasks
```

#### **Unit Test:**
Simulate multiple agents pulling tasks from the same shared context and validate task execution.

```python
def test_agent_task_pull():
    tasks = pull_tasks_from_swarm()
    assert tasks is not None, "Tasks were not retrieved"
    assert len(tasks) > 0, "No tasks found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_agent_task_pull()
```

#### **Expected Output:**
Multiple agents should successfully pull and execute tasks from a shared context using Swarm’s decentralized approach.

---

### **Step 5: Implement Unit Tests for Workflow Execution**

#### **Task:**
Create unit tests to ensure workflows execute correctly with the new context-driven environment variables.

#### **Commands:**
Implement Python’s `unittest` framework for validating task executions.

```python
import unittest
from byoai import workflow_executor

class TestWorkflowExecution(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_workflow_execution(self):
        result = workflow_executor.run_workflow("example_workflow.yml")
        self.assertEqual(result, "Expected Output")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

#### **Expected Output:**
All test cases should pass, confirming that workflows are correctly executed using the updated environment variables.

---

### **Step 6: Validate Logs and Monitoring**

#### **Task:**
Ensure that logs reflect the changes and agents log their tasks using the new context-driven terminology.

#### **Commands:**
Check the logs generated by the agents to ensure the task execution and agent registration are logged correctly under the new context variables.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/byoai/byoai-agent.log
```

#### **Unit Test:**
Create a script that checks for the correct log outputs.

```python
def test_logs_for_context_variables():
    with open("/var/log/byoai/byoai-agent.log") as log_file:
        log_contents = log_file.read()
        assert "CONTEXT_AGENT_PORT" in log_contents, "CONTEXT_AGENT_PORT not logged"
        assert "CONTEXT_WORKFLOW_DIR" in log_contents, "CONTEXT_WORKFLOW_DIR not logged"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_logs_for_context_variables()
```

#### **Expected Output:**
Logs should confirm successful agent registration and task execution using the new context variables.

---

### **Final Validation: Full Integration Test**

#### **Task:**
Run integration tests simulating full workflows across agents deployed on Docker or Kubernetes. Validate the following:
- Agent communication
- Task execution from shared contexts
- Logging

#### **Unit Test:**
Use `unittest` or an integration testing framework to validate full workflow execution.

```python
import unittest
from byoai import agent

class TestFullIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_full_workflow_execution(self):
        result = agent.run_full_workflow()
        self.assertTrue(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

#### **Expected Output:**
The system operates smoothly with the new context variables. All agents communicate, log, and execute tasks correctly.
