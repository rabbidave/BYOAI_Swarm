1. Task Management and Distribution
Success Criteria:

Task Prioritization: Tasks are assigned based on their priority. High-priority tasks are always executed first.
Specialization Handling: Tasks requiring a specific specialization are routed only to agents that can handle them.
Fairness and Efficiency: If multiple agents share a specialization, tasks should be distributed efficiently without overloading any single agent.
Key Questions for the Agent:

Can the system properly assign tasks of varying priorities to agents in the expected order?
Are tasks requiring specializations (e.g., “math”) only assigned to agents with matching capabilities?
When multiple agents can handle a task, how does the system ensure efficient task distribution?
Testing:

Create tasks with different priorities and specializations. Monitor how they are queued and distributed.
Ensure low-priority tasks don't block high-priority ones.
Simulate a mix of agents with varying specializations to check for distribution fairness.
2. API Stability and Error Handling
Success Criteria:

Error Messages: API responses should clearly indicate errors, such as malformed requests or missing required fields.
Valid Data Submission: Only valid JSON payloads are accepted for task creation, with appropriate validation for fields like task description, priority, and specialization.
Key Questions for the Agent:

Does the API return meaningful error messages for invalid or incomplete requests?
Is there proper validation for incoming data, ensuring that only tasks with the necessary details are processed?
Are edge cases (e.g., missing fields, non-JSON requests) handled gracefully?
Testing:

Send invalid requests (missing fields, incorrect data types) and monitor the API's behavior.
Ensure that valid requests are processed as expected and that responses contain appropriate task IDs and success messages.
Test various API methods (GET/POST) to verify consistency and clarity in responses.
3. Concurrency and Performance
Success Criteria:

Smooth Task Execution: Agents must be able to handle tasks concurrently without bottlenecks, and the system should prevent race conditions.
Queue Stability: The PriorityQueue must operate smoothly even under high loads (many tasks being added and executed).
Efficient Locking: Ensure that task queue operations and agent task retrievals don’t cause deadlocks or slowdowns.
Key Questions for the Agent:

How does the system perform when multiple tasks are being added rapidly?
Are agents retrieving and completing tasks without delay, and is there no unnecessary locking or contention?
Can the system scale with an increasing number of agents and tasks?
Testing:

Simulate heavy loads by creating many tasks in rapid succession and monitoring agent performance.
Test with multiple agents to observe concurrency and how the PriorityQueue handles load.
Monitor for any delays or deadlocks during task assignment and execution.
4. Logging and Monitoring
Success Criteria:

Detailed Logging: Logs should provide sufficient detail to trace the lifecycle of a task, from creation to completion, including assignment and status changes.
Clear Status Updates: The system should log both task and agent activities in a readable format.
Key Questions for the Agent:

Does the system log each task’s status (pending, in progress, completed) and include sufficient details about which agent handled the task?
Is it easy to monitor the current swarm state through logs and API calls?
Testing:

Execute a variety of tasks and check the logs to ensure each step of task creation, assignment, and completion is recorded.
Verify that logs clearly indicate which agent is handling a task, the task’s priority, and its final status.
5. Swarm State and Agent Management
Success Criteria:

Accurate Swarm State: The /swarm/state endpoint should return accurate information about active agents, pending tasks, and completed tasks.
Agent Specialization Management: Each agent’s specialization should be properly reflected in the system, and tasks should only be assigned to suitable agents.
Key Questions for the Agent:

Does the /swarm/state API provide a complete and accurate snapshot of the swarm, including all pending and completed tasks?
Are agent specializations correctly reflected in the state, and can the system track how agents are registered and used?
Testing:

Query the swarm state during different stages of operation (when tasks are pending, when tasks are in progress, when agents are idle) to ensure accuracy.
Test agent registration and task assignment based on specialization, and check the API responses for correctness.
6. Documentation and Usability
Success Criteria:

Comprehensive Documentation: The README and relevant files should be updated with clear instructions on how to interact with the new swarm-based system.
API Examples: Provide examples of how to use the API, including adding tasks, querying the swarm state, and managing agents.
Key Questions for the Agent:

Are the changes to the system documented clearly in the README, with an explanation of how the swarm works?
Does the API documentation include practical examples for users?
Testing:

Review the README for clarity and accuracy, ensuring that it provides enough information for others to understand and use the new swarm system.
Test the API with the provided examples to ensure they work as described.
Final Success Criteria Recap:
Task Distribution: Tasks are distributed based on priority and agent specialization, with no bottlenecks.
API Stability: The API works as intended, handling both valid and invalid requests gracefully.
Concurrency: The system performs efficiently with multiple agents handling tasks concurrently.
Logging: Logs provide a clear, detailed account of task and agent activity.
Accurate State Management: The swarm’s state is accurately reflected via the API.
Documentation: Clear and up-to-date documentation reflects the new swarm-based functionality.
